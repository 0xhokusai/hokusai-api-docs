### Meta Transaction

Meta transactions are a mechanism for transaction generators to process transactions without paying a fee.
The transaction generator sends a signed transaction to the server.
The service provider signs the received transaction and sends the transaction to the blockchain network in exchange for a fee.
By using Meta transaction, the transaction generator not only does not have to pay the fee, but also does not have to hold the native token.
