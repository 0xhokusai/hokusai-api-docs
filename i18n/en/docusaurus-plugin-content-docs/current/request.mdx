Hokusai Protocol requests follow the following protocol.
- All API requests should be sent over HTTPS.
- Parameters should be sent as a path, query, or JSON format request body.
- All API requests require a `key` parameter with the API Key as the value in the query parameter. See [authentication](/authentication) for details.

## Request Body

Some endpoints should be passed parameters in the request body. The request body is in the form of a JSON object, and the name of the key is denoted by [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
An example of a request body is shown below.
```json title="/nfts/{contractId}/mint"
